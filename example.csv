Rick and Morty,17 April 2020,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_and_Morty,"Rick and Morty is an American adult animated science fiction sitcom created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon for Cartoon Network's late-night programming block Adult Swim. The series follows the misadventures of cynical mad scientist Rick Sanchez and his good-hearted but fretful grandson Morty Smith, who split their time between domestic life and interdimensional adventures.Roiland voices the eponymous characters, with Chris Parnell, Spencer Grammer and Sarah Chalke voicing the rest of the family. The series originated from an animated short parody film of Back to the Future, created by Roiland for Channel 101, a short film festival co-founded by Harmon. The series has been acclaimed by critics for its originality, creativity and humor.The series has been picked up for an additional seventy episodes over an unspecified number of seasons, beginning with season 4. The fourth season premiered on November 10, 2019 consists of ten episodes.The show revolves around the adventures of the members of the Smith household, which consists of parents Jerry and Beth, their children Summer and Morty, and Beth's father, Rick Sanchez, who lives with them as a guest. According to Justin Roiland, the family lives outside of Seattle, Washington.[2] The adventures of Rick and Morty, however, take place across an infinite number of realities, with the characters travelling to other planets and dimensions through portals and Rick's flying car.Rick is an eccentric and alcoholic mad scientist, who eschews many ordinary conventions such as school, marriage, love, and family. He frequently goes on adventures with his 14-year-old grandson, Morty, a kind-hearted but easily distressed boy, whose naïve but grounded moral compass plays counterpoint to Rick's Machiavellian ego. Morty's 17-year-old sister, Summer, is a more conventional teenager who worries about improving her status among her peers and sometimes follows Rick and Morty on their adventures. The kids' mother, Beth, is a generally level-headed person and assertive force in the household, though self-conscious about her professional role as a horse surgeon. She is dissatisfied with her marriage to Jerry, a simple-minded and insecure person, who disapproves of Rick's influence over his family.Different versions of the characters inhabit other dimensions throughout the multiverse and their personal characteristics can vary from one reality to another. The show's original Rick identifies himself as Rick Sanchez of Earth Dimension C-137, in reference to his original universe, but this does not necessarily apply to every other member of the Smith household. For instance, in the first-season episode Rick Potion #9, after turning the entire world population into monsters, Rick and Morty move to a different dimension, leaving Summer, Beth and Jerry behind.In May 2012, Adult Swim unveiled its development slate that included a Rick and Morty pilot from Harmon and Roiland,[7] which was eventually picked up to series in October 2012, as one of the network's first primetime original shows.[8] The first season premiered in December 2013 and concluded in April 2014. It comprised eleven episodes (including the pilot), and aired Mondays at 10:30pm ET/PT.[9]Two months earlier, in February 2014, the show had been renewed for a second season, with the press release noting that Rick and Morty consistently outperformed direct competition in its time slot.[10] Season two aired Sundays at 11:30pm ET/PT, from July to October 2015, and comprised ten episodes.[11] In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Roiland said that Rick and Morty will remain a big priority above anything else for him in the future, and expressed his intention to keep the show growing.[12]Adult Swim renewed Rick and Morty for a third season in August 2015, shortly after a successful second-season premiere.[13] The two co-creators and executive producers expressed their delight at the series' popularity.[14] The season premiered unannounced on April 1, 2017, as part of an April Fools' prank. The remaining episodes began airing weekly almost four months later, continuing in the same time slot from season two, and the initial airing concluded in October 2017.[15] Although it was originally intended for the season to consist of fourteen episodes, as a result of production delays it eventually comprised only ten.[16]Following the conclusion of the show's third season, co-creators Harmon and Roiland wanted to have assurance that there would be many more seasons of Rick and Morty in the future, so that they would be able to focus on the show and minimize their involvement in other projects.[17] Additionally, Harmon had expressed his wish for the upcoming fourth season to consist of more than ten episodes.[18] In May 2018, after prolonged contract negotiations, Adult Swim announced a long-term deal with the creators, ordering 70 new episodes over an unspecified number of seasons.[19] Roiland was confident that this big renewal deal will allow the creators to minimize the gaps between seasons, as they will be able to schedule their time around the show and keep the machine going.[20]In May 2019, the fourth season of Rick and Morty was announced to debut in November 2019.[21] The fourth season will consist of ten episodes split across two airings.[22] The first five episode began airing on November 10, 2019,[23] while the remaining five episodes will begin airing on May 3, 2020.[24]Rick and Morty was created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon. The duo first met at Channel 101, a non-profit monthly short film festival in Los Angeles co-founded by Harmon.[25] At Channel 101, participants submit a short film in the format of a pilot, and a live audience decides which pilots continue as a series. Roiland, then a producer on reality programming, began submitting content to the festival a year after its launch, in 2004. His pilots typically consisted of shock value—sick and twisted elements that received a confused reaction from the audience.[25] Nevertheless, Harmon took a liking to his humor and the two began collaborating. In 2006, Roiland was fired from working on a television series he regarded as intensely creatively stifling, and funneled his creative energies into creating a webisode for Channel 101. The result was The Real Animated Adventures of Doc and Mharti, an animated short starring parodies of Doc Brown and Marty McFly, characters from the Back to the Future film trilogy.[26] In the short, which Harmon would dub a bastardization, a pornographic vandalization, Doc Smith urges Mharti that the solution to all of his problems is to give him oral sex.[27] The audience reacted to it wildly, and Roiland began creating more shorts involving the characters, which soon evolved beyond his original intentions and their obvious origin within the film from which it was culled.[27][28] Harmon would later create and produce Community, an NBC sitcom, while Roiland would work primarily in voice acting for Disney's Fish Hooks and Cartoon Network's Adventure Time.In 2012, Harmon was briefly fired from Community. Adult Swim, searching for a more prime-time, hit show,[29] approached Harmon shortly afterward, who initially viewed the channel as unfit for his style. He also was unfamiliar with animation, and his process for creating television focuses more heavily on dialogue, characters, and story.[28] Instead, he phoned Roiland to inquire if he had any ideas for an animated series. Roiland immediately brought up the idea of using the Doc and Mharti characters, renamed Rick and Morty.[27] Roiland initially wanted the show's run time to consist of one eleven-minute segment, but Adult Swim pushed for a half-hour program.[29] Harmon felt the best way to extend the voices into a program would be to build a family around the characters, while Adult Swim development executive Nick Weidenfeld suggested that Rick be Morty's grandfather. Having pitched multiple television programs that did not get off the ground, Roiland was initially very unreceptive to others attempting to give notes on his pitch.[27] Prior to developing Rick and Morty, he had created three failed animated pilots for Fox, and he had begun to feel burned out with developing television.[28]The first draft was completed in six hours on the Paramount Pictures lot in Dan Harmon's unfurnished Community office.[30] The duo had broken the story that day, sold the pilot, and then sat down to write.[28][31] Roiland, while acknowledging a tendency for procrastination, encouraged Harmon to stay and write the entire first draft.[30] We were sitting on the floor, cross-legged with laptops and I was about to get up and go home and he said, 'Wait, if you go home, it might take us three months to write this thing. Stay here right now and we can write it in six hours.' He just had a premonition about that, recalled Harmon.[28] Adult Swim was initially unsure of Roiland doing both voices, partially due to the undeveloped nature of the character of Morty. Harmon wrote four short premises in which Morty took a more assertive role and sent it to Mike Lazzo.[30] Adult Swim placed a tamer TV-14 rating on the program, which initially was met with reluctance from the show's staff. The network's reason behind the rating was that it would soon begin broadcasting in prime-time, competing with major programs.[28]The theme song for Rick and Morty by Ryan Elder was originally used in a rejected Cartoon Network pilot Roiland made called Dog World, which was referenced in the episode Lawnmower Dog.[32]Harmon has noted that the writers' room at the show's studio bears a striking resemblance to the one used for Community.[28] In comparing the two, he noted that the writing staff of Rick and Morty was significantly smaller, and more rough and tumble verbally.[28] The first season writing staff consisted of Roiland, Harmon, Tom Kauffman, Ryan Ridley, Wade Randolph, and Eric Acosta, while writer's assistant Mike McMahan was also given writing credit. Described as a very, very tiny little writers' room with a lot of heavy lifting from everybody, the show's writing staff, like many Adult Swim productions, is not unionized with the Writers' Guild of America.[33] The writing staff first meets and discusses ideas, which evolve into a story.[25] Discussions often include anecdotes from personal life as well as thoughts on the science fiction genre.[28] After breaking the story—which consists of developing its consistency and logical beginning, middle, and conclusion—a writer is assigned to create an outline. Roiland and Harmon do a pass on the outline, and from there the episode undergoes several more drafts. The final draft of the script is last approved by either of the co-creators.[25] Harmon has admitted that his perfectionism can sometimes be disruptive and cause writing schedule delays. For the most part, this was the reason why the third season of the show consisted of only 10 episodes instead of 14, as was initially intended.[34][35]Many episodes are structured with use of a story circle, a Harmon creation based largely on Joseph Campbell's monomyth, or The Hero's Journey. Its two-act structure places the act break at an odd location in the stages of the monomyth: after The Meeting with the Goddess, instead of Atonement with the Father.[30] Roiland has stated his and Harmon's intentions for the series to lack traditional continuity, opting for discontinuous storylines not bound by rules.[36] He has also confirmed that the writers avoid revisiting old tropes from the show's past, in fear of that coming off as disingenuous fan service.[37] In producing the series' first season, episodes were occasionally written out of order. For example, Rick Potion #9 was the second episode written for the series, but was instructed to be animated as the fifth, as it would make more sense within the series' continuity.[25]Animation for the show is done using Toon Boom Harmony, post-production work is done in Adobe After Effects, and background art is done in Adobe Photoshop.[38] Production of animation is handled by Bardel Entertainment in Vancouver, Canada.[39]Roiland's cartooning style is heavily indebted to The Simpsons, a factor he acknowledged in a 2013 interview, while also comparing his style to that of Pendleton Ward (Adventure Time) and J. G. Quintel (Regular Show): You'll notice mouths are kind of similar and teeth are similar, but I think that's also a stylistic thing that... all of us are kind of the same age, and we're all inspired by The Simpsons and all these other shows we're kind of subconsciously tapping into.[33] John Kricfalusi's The Ren & Stimpy Show was another strong influence for Rick and Morty, which is why, according to Roiland, the small w-shaped mouths that the characters occasionally make is a reference to a similar expression that Ren frequently makes.[40] Talking about the style guide the animators of the show have to follow, season three art director Jeffrey Thompson explained that the characters are often drawn with odd or asymmetrical features, in order to avoid looking too normal to live in the Rick and Morty universe.[41]When recording dialogue, Roiland does a considerable amount of improvisation, in order to make the characters feel more natural.[42]The general formula of Rick and Morty consists of the juxtaposition of two conflicting scenarios: an extremely selfish, alcoholic grandfather dragging his grandson along for interdimensional adventures, intercut with domestic family drama.[27][29] Co-creator Dan Harmon has described the series as a cross between Matt Groening's two shows The Simpsons and Futurama, balancing family life with heavy science fiction.[33] The series is inspired by British-style storytelling, as opposed to traditional American family TV stories.[25] Harmon has stated that his inspiration behind much of the concept and humor for the series comes from various British television series, such as The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and Doctor Who. He figures that the audience will only understand developments from Morty's point of view, but stated we don't want to be the companions. We want to hang out with  the Doctor, we idolize the Doctor, but we don't think like him, and that's really interesting.[43]Occasionally, characters will acknowledge an episode's narrative or hint at the presence of a fourth wall, suggesting that they are aware of the fact that they are characters of a TV show. Thereunder, Troy Patterson of The New Yorker notes that Rick and Morty supplies an artful answer to the question of what follows postmodernism: a decadent regurgitation of all its tropes, all at once, leavened by some humanistic wistfulness.[44] Sean Sebastian of Junkee says that the show can be both hilarious and deeply disturbing at the same time as it excels at the intersection between big ideas, flippancy and wit.[45]Rick and Morty has been described as a never-ending fart joke wrapped around a studied look into nihilism.[46] The series addresses the insignificance of human existence as compared to the size of the universe, with no recognizable divine presence, as described by Lovecraft's philosophy of cosmicism. The characters of the show deal with cosmic horror and existential dread, either by asserting the utility of science over magic or by choosing a life in ignorant bliss.[47] However, as Joachim Heijndermans of Geeks notes, none of them appear able to handle the absurd and chaotic nature of the universe, as Jerry gets by through denial, and Rick is a depressed, substance-addicted, suicidal mess.[48]Harmon describes Rick as a self-interested anarchist, who doesn't like being told what to do.[49] He believes that the character's life on a larger scale has caused him mental illness,[43] and opines that the knowledge that nothing matters—while accurate—gets you nowhere.[50] Matthew Bulger of The Humanist notes that the creators of the series are trying to communicate the message that we need to focus on human relationships and not preoccupy our minds with unanswerable questions, in order to find a sense of purpose and live a better life.[51] Eric Armstrong of The New Republic notes that Morty represents the audience, as he is mostly there to react to Rick's deranged schemes. The character is transformed by the truths he discovers during his interdimensional adventures with his grandfather. However, instead of sinking into depression, Morty accepts these truths that empower him to value his own life.[52]The show is available to watch on Netflix in a number of countries outside the United States, including Australia, while the first three seasons are available to stream domestically on Hulu.[53] Following the conclusion of the show's third season, Adult Swim made a livestream marathon of Rick and Morty available to watch on its official website in select regions,[54] hoping to dissuade viewers from watching other illegal livestreams.[55]In the United Kingdom, public-service broadcaster Channel 4 outbid Netflix and began airing the series with season 4, which represents its first pickup by an international television channel.[56] Season 4 was originally scheduled to premiere on Channel 4 in January 2020; viewer complaints resulted in the broadcaster moving the first episode forward to 20 November on E4.[57]The 11-episode first season was released on DVD (2-disc set) and Blu-ray (single BD-50 disc) on October 7, 2014. Special features include commentary and animatics for every episode, deleted scenes, behind the scenes featurette and commentaries by special guests Matt Groening, Robert Kirkman, Pendleton Ward, Al Jean and others.[58][59] The 10-episode second season was released on DVD (2-disc set) and Blu-ray (single BD-50 disc) on June 7, 2016. Special features include behind the scenes, commentary and animatics for every episode, deleted animatic sketches and a Plumbus Owner's Manual booklet.[60][61] The 10-episode third season, was released on DVD (2-disc set) and Blu-ray (single BD-50 disc) on May 15, 2018. Special features include exclusive commentary and animatics for every episode, inside the episode, the origins of Rick and Morty, and an exclusive inside the recording booth session.[62] On February 12, 2019, a set containing seasons 1-3 was released on DVD and Blu-ray.[63]Uncensored versions of the show are also available to purchase on various digital platforms, including iTunes and Amazon, with the digital releases of each season containing bonus material.[53] The digital release of the first season includes the 2013 Rick and Morty Comic-Con panel,[64] the digital release of the second season includes the 2015 ATX Television Festival panel,[65] and the digital release of the third season includes commentary on every episode, as well as seven more short videos featuring co-creators Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland.[66]Rick and Morty has received near-universal critical acclaim, holding an approval rating of 94% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes for the entire series.[67] David Weigand of San Francisco Chronicle described it as offbeat and occasionally coarse... the take-away here is that it works. He praised the animation direction by James McDermott for being fresh, colorful and as wacky as the script, and states that the series possesses shades of Futurama, South Park and even Beetlejuice, ultimately opining that its humor felt entirely original.[68] Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times praised the series and stated that it was Grandparenting at its unhinged finest.[69] In a review shortly after the second-season premiere, Sean Sebastian of Junkee said that although the crude animation and over-the-top voice acting might have discouraged some viewers to continue watching, Rick and Morty is exceptionally well-made and that the more you dissect it, the more you find it has to say.[45]Todd Spangler of Variety gave the series a lukewarm review; while he found the series was passable, he contrasted it with other Adult Swim series as often seems overly reliant on simply being frenetic at the expense of being witty and enjoyed it as a welcome attempt to dream just a little bigger.[70] David Sims of The A.V. Club gave the series an A−. In reviewing the first two episodes, he complimented the animation for its clean, simple style. He stated that while the series has a dark, sick sensibility, he praised its effort to give each character a little bit of depth, further applauding Roiland's voice talent for the eponymous characters.[71]"

He studied the butterflies of the Indian Subcontinent and wrote a three volume monograph on the butterflies of India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Burma and Sri Lanka.Born in a noble Huguenot family, his father was a physician. He was educated at St. John's College at Hurstpierpoint near Brighton.[2] Leaving England for India in 1870, de Nicéville became a clerk in a government office (Calcutta Small Cause Court) but from at least 1881, devoted all of his spare time to entomology. He worked with most 'Indian' entomologists of the day but especially with Henry John Elwes, Taylor, Wood–Mason, Martin and Marshall. At this time, he made several trips to Sikkim. In 1887 he made a trip to the Baltistan glaciers along with John Henry Leech.[2] He made collections on these trips and wrote a series of papers in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal (1881, 1882, 1883 and 1885) and in 1890 the results were summarised in the Gazetteer of Sikhim (1890) in which G. A Gammie and De Niceville recorded about 631 species of butterflies found in Sikkim. Also included were butterflies found in Darjeeling, Buxa and Bhutan, areas contiguous with Sikkim state1899 was a year of great famine coinciding with George Nathaniel Curzon's appointment as Viceroy of India. Curzon was hugely energetic and supportive of government efforts to help agriculture. Our real reform has been to endeavour for the first time to apply science on a large scale to the study and practice of Indian agriculture. he wrote in 1901. Curzon began in 1901 by elevating the Bombay director of agriculture to the new position of inspector-general of agriculture. Curzon also undertook the expansion of provincial research, linked to districts by experiment as well as demonstration farms. In 1901 he appointed an imperial mycologist and an imperial entomologist; two years later, he appointed an imperial agriculturalist and an imperial economic botanist. The entomologist was de Nicéville, who whilst a lepidopterist was able to co-ordinate work on other insect orders.He was a Corresponding Member of the Zoological Society of London and a Fellow of the Entomological Society.He married Jane Sarah Webb, a widow, at St James' Church Calcutta on September 21, 1881.

Baba Brinkman,4 March 2020,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Brinkman,"Dirk Murray Baba Brinkman (born October 22, 1978) is a Canadian rapper and playwright best known for recordings and performances that combine hip hop music with literature, theatre, and science.Born in the remote community of Riondel, British Columbia, in a log cabin built by his parents,[1] Brinkman is the eldest of three children of Joyce Murray, a Member of the Parliament of Canada, and Dirk Brinkman, Sr., who is notable for having founded the world's only private company responsible for planting more than one billion trees.[2] Dirk Sr gave Brinkman the honorific nickname Baba at birth, because of his son's contemplative, Buddha-like expression.[3] Brinkman's childhood was divided between Vancouver and the Kootenay region of British Columbia.[4]Brinkman spent his early summers in remote tree planting camps, and began planting trees himself at the age of 15.[5] He worked for his parents' business, Brinkman & Associates Reforestation, for twelve seasons in British Columbia and Alberta, personally planting more than one million trees.[6] During this period he also earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English Literature from Simon Fraser University and a Master of Arts degree in Comparative Literature from the University of Victoria, Canada. He studied human evolution and primatology with the orangutan researcher Biruté Galdikas[7] and wrote his thesis comparing modern Hip hop freestyle battling with The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer.[8]Brinkman is married to cognitive neuroscientist and television host Dr. Heather Berlin. They have a daughter, Hannah, born in 2013, and a son, Dylan, born in 2016.[9]Brinkman first gained widespread media attention for his one-man show The Rap Canterbury Tales, devised as a means of re-telling Chaucer's iconic stories for a modern audience.[10][11] The show premiered at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2004, and the following year Brinkman was sponsored by Cambridge University to perform the show in British secondary schools.[12] The Rap Canterbury Tales was published as an illustrated paperback by Talon Books in 2006.[13]Brinkman's 2010 follow-up show, Rapconteur, premiered at the Edinburgh Free Fringe and featured hip hop adaptations of Beowulf, the Epic of Gilgamesh, and the Finnish Kalevala.[14][15][16]In 2011, Brinkman premiered The Canterbury Tales Remixed at the Soho Playhouse in New York City.[17] The show combined material from Rapconteur with new adaptations of The Merchant's Tale, The Pardoner's Tale, and The Wife of Bath's Tale and was released as a full-length album in 2012.[18]Because of his interest in merging hip-hop and classic literature, Brinkman has referred to his style of rap as Lit Hop, which was also the title of his 2006 solo rap album.[19]In 2008, Brinkman was commissioned to write a new rap show about evolution by Professor Mark Pallen, microbiologist and author of The Rough Guide to Evolution. The result was The Rap Guide to Evolution, a hip hop homage to Charles Darwin which Brinkman first performed in Britain for the Darwin bicentennial in February 2009.[20] Because the lyrics were fact-checked for scientific accuracy, Professor Pallen calls it the first peer-reviewed rap.[21] Brinkman cites Richard Dawkins, David Sloan Wilson, Jared Diamond, Geoffrey Miller, and E. O. Wilson as his influences in writing the show.The Rap Guide to Evolution premiered at the 2009 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, winning a Fringe First Award from The Scotsman for best new theatre writing.[22] In 2010 the UK's largest biomedical charity, the Wellcome Trust, provided grant funding for Brinkman to make a series of educational music videos based on the show, as a resource for biology teachers.[23] The Rap Guide to Evolution completed a five-month Off-Broadway theatre run in November 2011,[24] for which Brinkman received a 2012 Drama Desk Award nomination for Outstanding Solo Performance, losing to Irish actor Cillian Murphy.[25]Brinkman has performed selections from The Rap Guide to Evolution on The Rachel Maddow Show[26] and at the Seattle Science Festival, sharing the stage with Jurassic Park palaeontologist Jack Horner and British physicist Stephen Hawking.[27]In 2010 Brinkman produced a Rationalist Anthem called Off That, attacking various forms of pseudoscience. The song was inspired by the Jay Z track of the same name, which is featured on The Blueprint 3 album. The video for Brinkman's unauthorized remix was released as part of an online science music festival called Geek Pop[28] and was popular with atheist blogs.[29][30]Brinkman followed up his Darwin tribute with a sequel show specifically about evolutionary psychology, The Rap Guide to Human Nature, which premiered at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2010.[31] The album features peer review phone messages from David Buss, Olivia Judson, and David Sloan Wilson commenting on the science content in Brinkman's lyrics.[32] In 2012 Human Nature was adapted into a theatre production, Ingenious Nature, which ran off-Broadway from November 2012 through January 2013.[33]In March 2012, Brinkman was announced as a songwriter-in-residence at the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis (NIMBioS) and spent a month at the University of Tennessee Knoxville as a guest of the Institute, along with DJ and music producer Jamie Simmonds.[34] Brinkman later released The Infomatic EP, a collection of hip-hop songs inspired by computational biology.[35]Brinkman's next play, Rap Guide to Religion, premiered at the 2014 Edinburgh Fringe,[36] before transferring to the Soho Playhouse for an off-Broadway run in October 2014. The production ran for seven months and was a Time Out New York[37] and New York Times Critics' Pick, as well as receiving a 2015 Drama Desk Award nomination in the category Unique Theatrical Experience.[38] The show explores theories from the cognitive science of religion and promotes religious naturalism, prompting American Humanist Association magazine to refer to Brinkman as atheism's best salesman.[39]In 2015, Brinkman was commissioned by Arizona State University and Dr. Randolph Nesse to write and produce an album entitled The Rap Guide to Medicine, which communicates themes from evolutionary medicine. Dr. Nesse said of the finished project: This is amazing. I won't need to teach my course, I'll just have students listen to the album![40] The album includes songs about Mendelian disease, parasitology, somatic evolution in cancer, mismatch theory, and senescence.[41]In 2014 and 2016, Brinkman attended the Science of Consciousness conference in Tucson, AZ, performing a Rap Up or daily rap summary of the conference talks on Neuroscience and Philosophy of Mind.[42] Computational neuroscientist Anil Seth saw Brinkman's performances and proposed they collaborate on a new show about the neuroscience of consciousness.[43] Brinkman premiered Rap Guide to Consciousness at the 2017 Brighton Fringe, Winnipeg Fringe and Edinburgh Fringe to critical acclaim.[44][45][46] The show explores several neurobiological theories of consciousness, including Global Workspace Theory, Integrated Information Theory, and Predictive Coding, as well as the Philosophical Zombie, Free Will, Materialism, and Memetics.[47]Brinkman was commissioned by the WILD Foundation to produce The Rap Guide to Wilderness in 2014. The album was critically acclaimed and features songs about biodiversity, extinction, conservation, habitat loss and trophic cascade.[48][49][50][51][52]In 2015 Brinkman's play Rap Guide to Climate Chaos premiered at the Edinburgh Fringe,[53][54][55] followed by performances at the COP21 United Nations Climate Change Conference.[56] Climate Chaos went on to play-off-Broadway for six months in 2016, and featured Michael E. Mann, Gavin Schmidt, Naomi Oreskes and Bill Nye as talkback speakers.[57][58] Bill Nye also features on the album version of Climate Chaos, rapping the chorus of the track What's Beef, which remixes a Notorious B.I.G. song to discuss climate change denial.[59] Rap Guide to Climate Chaos summarizes the science, politics, and economics of climate change and advocates for a global carbon tax as part of the solution.[60]In 2016, after the election of Donald Trump, Brinkman worked with Wesleyan University professor Gary Yohe, a senior contributor to the IPCC and co-recipient along with Al Gore of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, to produce a new song and video entitled Erosion, summarizing data from the National Climate Assessment on the US-based physical impacts of climate change.[61][62]Brinkman and his wife, the neuroscientist Dr. Heather Berlin, co-wrote and performed in a science comedy variety show entitled Off The Top at the Edinburgh Fringe in 2014, 2015, and 2017 about the neuroscience of improvisation and freestyle rap.[63][64][65]The Rap Guide to Evolution won the National Center for Science Education's 2013 Friend of Darwin Award.[66]Teachers have also expressed concern about Brinkman's use of strong language and anti-religious sentiments in his educational performances and videos.[67]Brinkman himself has been described as an evangelical atheist[68] and has blogged about his encounters with creationists, both in educational settings[69] and within his own family.[70] He also performed in support of the Military Association of Atheists & Freethinkers Rock Beyond Belief concert alongside Richard Dawkins at Fort Bragg, NC in 2012.[71]Ingenious Nature was reviewed unfavourably, and Brinkman received criticism for singling out women in the audience, pointing at them, and rapping about their ovulation cycles, among other things.[72]The song Tranquility Bank from The Rap Guide to Wilderness received a hostile response from some environmentalists because of its assertion that urban living is better for the environment than back-to-the-land movements.[73]2004: The Rap Canterbury Tales2008: The Rebel Cell (co-written with Dizraeli)2009: The Rap Guide to Evolution2010: Rapconteur2010: The Rap Guide to Human Nature2011: The Canterbury Tales Remixed2012: Ingenious Nature2014: The Rap Guide to Religion2015: The Rap Guide to Climate Chaos2017: The Rap Guide to Consciousness2004: Swordplay2004: The Rap Canterbury Tales2005: Pandemonium2006: Lit-Hop2008: Mine the Gap (Mud Sun)2008: The Rebel Cell (Mud Sun)2009: The Rap Guide to Evolution2009: Apocalyptic Utopian Dreams in the Western Wilderness2010: Rapconteur2010: The Rap Guide to Human Nature2011: The Rap Guide to Evolution: Revised2011: The Rap Guide to Business2012: The Canterbury Tales Remixed2012: The Infomatic EP2014: The Rap Guide to Wilderness2015: The Rap Guide to Medicine2015: The Rap Guide to Religion2016: The Rap Guide to Climate Chaos2017: The Rap Guide to Consciousness2019: See From SpaceThe Rap Canterbury Tales, Talon Books 2006The Speciation of Rap The Evolutionary Review, Volume 2, March 2011Finding 'God' in the Female Orgasm The Evolutionary Review, Volume 3, May 2012Darwin On The Mic Evolution, Volume 69, Issue 5"

"Hyde, Pennsylvania",10 April 2020,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde,_Pennsylvania","Hyde is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Clearfield County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 1,399 at the 2010 census.[1]Hyde is located in the western part of Lawrence Township at 41°0′11″N 78°27′47″W﻿ / ﻿41.00306°N 78.46306°W﻿ / 41.00306; -78.46306 (41.003057, -78.463096),[2] on the southwest side of Clearfield, the county seat.

Politics of New Hampshire,13 March 2020,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_New_Hampshire,"New Hampshire is often noted for its moderate politics (especially in relation to strongly Democratic neighboring states) and its status as a prominent swing state. Voters predominantly selected Republicans for national office during the 19th and 20th centuries until 1992. Since then, the state has been considered as a swing state, and the Cook Political Report now classifies New Hampshire as Even after the 2016 election, reflecting that neither party has an advantage. Since 2006, control of the state legislature and New Hampshire's congressional seats have switched back and forth between Republicans and Democrats in a series of wave elections.Due to its large State House, the annual town meetings in most communities, and the prominence of the New Hampshire Primary every four years, New Hampshire has been noted for its high level of political participation and retail politics.[clarification needed] Some have called politics the state sport.[1]Historically, New Hampshire was a staunchly conservative state and regularly voted Republican, with only Hillsborough County leaning Democratic before the 1970s. Some sources trace the founding of the Republican Party to the town of Exeter in 1853. Prior to 1992, New Hampshire had only strayed from the Republican Party for three presidential candidates—Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson. The state voted for Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan twice by overwhelming majorities.Beginning in 1992, New Hampshire became a swing state in both national and local elections. The state supported Democrats Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996, John Kerry in 2004, and Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Among the states that George W. Bush won in the 2000 election, it was the only one to go Democratic in the 2004 election. The state elected two Democrats to the Governorship during this period.The voters selected Democrats in New Hampshire as they did nationally in 2006 and 2008. In 2006, Democrats won both congressional seats (electing Carol Shea-Porter in the 1st district and Paul Hodes in the 2nd district), re-elected Governor John Lynch, and gained a majority on the Executive Council and in both houses of the legislature for the first time since 1911. Democrats had not held both the legislature and the governorship since 1874.[2] Neither U.S. Senate seat was up for a vote in 2006. In 2008, Democrats retained their majorities, governorship, and congressional seats; and former governor Jeanne Shaheen defeated incumbent Republican John E. Sununu for the U.S. Senate in a rematch of the 2002 contest. At the end of the 2008 election cycle, voters registered Democratic outnumbered those registered Republican.A 2006 University of New Hampshire survey found that New Hampshire residents who had moved to the state from Massachusetts were mostly Republican. The influx of new Republican voters from Massachusetts has resulted in Republican strongholds in the Boston exurban border towns of Hillsborough and Rockingham counties, while other areas have become increasingly Democratic. The study indicated that immigrants from states other than Massachusetts tended to lean Democratic.[3]In the 2010 midterm elections, New Hampshire voted out both of its Democratic members in the House of Representatives in favor of Republicans. Republicans also won control of both chambers of the State House by veto-proof majorities, while Governor John Lynch, a Democrat, won a fourth term, unprecedented in modern times.Two years later, in the 2012 elections, New Hampshire voted out both of its Republican members in the House of Representatives in favor of Democrats. At the same time, voters returned Democrats to the majority in the State House of Representatives, while Republicans held on to a narrow 13-11 majority in the state Senate, despite losing the popular vote. Democrat Maggie Hassan won a surprisingly large 12% margin of victory, with 54.6% of the vote in the gubernatorial election, becoming the first Democrat to succeed another Democrat as Governor of New Hampshire since 1854.In the 2016 elections, Republicans gained control of the governor's office and both chambers of the state legislature, giving full power at the state level to Republicans.[4] However, the state narrowly went to Democrat Hillary Clinton over Republican Donald Trump in that year's presidential election, while former Democratic governor Maggie Hassan defeated incumbent Republican Kelly Ayotte to join Senator Jeanne Shaheen and Representatives Carol Shea-Porter and Ann McLane Kuster to make the entire United States congressional delegations from New Hampshire represented by the Democratic party.In the 2018 midterm elections, both chambers of the state legislature returned to Democratic control with a Republican governor.Due to New Hampshire's large legislature and the state's history of volunteerism, women have held more political positions in the state than in many others. Since 1975, women have made up at least one-quarter of the state legislature.[5]The 2008 elections resulted in women holding the majority of seats (13 of the 24) in the New Hampshire Senate, a first for any legislative body in the United States.[6]Following the 2012 elections, New Hampshire had the first all-female congressional delegation in the country, when Carol Shea-Porter and Ann McLane Kuster were elected to the House of Representatives, joining Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Kelly Ayotte, who had been elected in 2008 and 2010, respectively.[7] The 2012 election also saw New Hampshire elect its second female governor, Maggie Hassan.Following the 2016 elections, New Hampshire had the first all-female, all-Democratic delegation in the country, when Maggie Hassan defeated incumbent Republican senator Kelly Ayotte in the New Hampshire senate race. Hassan serves alongside Democratic senator Jeanne Shaheen. In the US House, Carol Shea-Porter, a Democrat, defeated incumbent Representative Frank Guinta to represent the 1st Congressional District in New Hampshire again and serving alongside Representative Ann McLane Kuster, a Democrat, who won re-election to represent the 2nd Congressional District.[8]Same-sex marriage became legal in New Hampshire on January 1, 2010, replacing civil unions, which had become legal on January 1, 2008. In doing so, New Hampshire became the first state to recognize same-sex marriage entirely through the legislative process.After winning veto-proof majorities in both houses of the state legislature in 2010, the Republican leadership in the House attempted to repeal New Hampshire's same-sex marriage law. On March 21, 2012, however, the House defeated the repeal bill on a vote of 211 to 116.[9]Democrat Maggie Hassan, a supporter of same-sex marriage, ran against the legislature's record and won election as governor in November 2012[10] and Democrats took control of the House.[11]New Hampshire has also been noted for its libertarian tendencies, with its history of social libertarianism and fiscal restraint. New Hampshire perennially provides popular resistance to proposed seat-belt and motorcycle-helmet laws. Automobile insurance is optional under normal circumstances.[12]The state motto of Live Free or Die is another political touchstone. In 2006, when welcome signs at the border began to display the marketing slogan, You're Going to Love It Here, a firestorm erupted and Governor John Lynch acceded to a privately financed effort to erect new signs bearing the state motto. In 1997, a comparable firestorm had greeted a new issue of car license plates on which the motto was printed rather than embossed; the design was promptly changed to increase the size of the motto. (However, the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled in 1977 that those who object to the motto may tape over or cover up the words, either partially or completely.[13])When Senator Judd Gregg included an earmark in the REAL ID Act to compensate New Hampshire for being the first state to implement the Act in 2007, the state legislature enacted a law[14] calling the Act contrary and repugnant to the state and federal Bill of Rights and prohibiting the state executive branch from implementing it.[15]New Hampshire's libertarian reputation led the Free State Project to select it by vote for a mass in-migration.[16] Roughly 20 Free Staters, many of whom moved to New Hampshire specifically to participate in the Free State Project, have been elected state representatives, including roughly 10 who are currently serving, but none have been elected to higher offices. Many of those who have run have not made their affiliation with the Free State Project a prominent feature of their campaigns.[17] The Free State Project has met with opposition not only from Democrats, but also from many within the Republican Party, the party in which most Free State-affiliated candidates have run.[18]Some Free Staters have conducted acts of civil disobedience to demonstrate their opposition to what they call victimless crimes. Free Keene, a group of Free Staters in that city, has attracted particular attention to the high number of acts of civil disobedience, which have often been considered confrontational, and their effect on Keene's image and economy.[19] In recent years, a group of Free Keene members, calling themselves Robin Hooders have fed expired parking meters and videotaped their encounters with the parking enforcement officers, suggesting that the officers should refrain from writing tickets and get a different job. The close encounters with the Robin Hooders resulted in one officer resigning his position and a lawsuit filed by the City of Keene citing harassment of their employees.[20] In December 2013, the judge overseeing the case dismissed the city's arguments against the Robin Hooders on first amendment grounds, citing the public sidewalks' role as a traditional public forum.[21]During the Pumpkin Festival Riots of 2014 the Free Keene group claimed the police should have done more to stop the crimes being committed.[22]Taxation is a perennial electoral issue in New Hampshire, where there is strong opposition to broad-based taxes.  Their absence is not absolute; there is a 9% tax on meals and rentals,[23] and a 5% income tax on dividends and interest;[24] moreover, the state's 8.5% Business Enterprise Tax[25] is essentially an income tax on sole proprietors. However, candidates for legislature and Governor are routinely asked to take The Pledge against broad-based taxes.The property tax is the source of nearly all municipal revenue. It is broad-based (affecting even renters, indirectly) but does not attract the same controversy because municipal expenditures are voted locally, typically by Town Meeting, in which every voter can participate.In 2002, in response to court-ordered statewide equalization of education funding (see the Claremont Decision), New Hampshire instituted a statewide property tax. The tax is lower than the amount already assessed by municipalities, it is collected by municipalities, and is essentially returned to them, though legislative adjustments create donor towns and recipient towns. Each new legislature has considered changes to the distribution formula.Taxes that are not broad-based (that is, that residents could avoid paying) have not aroused comparable controversy. For example, the meals and rentals tax disproportionately impacts tourists and visitors, who do not vote. Recent legislatures have covered increased spending with increases in sin taxes, tolls, and filing fees. Some feel it would be simpler and fairer to enact a broad-based tax; in 2008, various Town Meetings considered citizen petitions against The Pledge. In particular, the property tax is seen as unfairly impacting the poor and especially retirees. Advocates of a state broad-based tax say it would permit higher state payments to municipalities, enabling them to lower property taxes. The opposing argument is that a new state tax would not change this alleviate local taxes, but would eventually lead to more state spending.New Hampshire's lower tax burden has also induced contiguous Amesbury and Salisbury, Massachusetts, and not-nearly-contiguous Killington, Vermont in 2004 and 2005, to petition to become part of New Hampshire.[26]  This reflected local discontent with restrictions on liberty or profitability, rather than any expectation that their own states plus the U.S. Congress would grant the necessary permission."

When it was available the aircraft was supplied in the form of plans for amateur construction, but the plans were withdrawn on 29 June 2000.[1][2]The Questar XLS was designed to comply with the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles rules, including the category's maximum empty weight of 254 lb (115 kg). The aircraft has a standard empty weight of 240 lb (109 kg).[1]The aircraft features a strut-braced high-wing, a single-seat open cockpit without a windshield, fixed tricycle landing gear without wheel pants and a single engine in pusher configuration.[1]The Questar XLS is made from bolted-together 6061-T6 aluminum tubing, with its flying surfaces covered in doped aircraft fabric. Its 31.30 ft (9.5 m) span wing has a wing area of 146.0 sq ft (13.56 m2), is supported by V struts and the wing can be detached in ten minutes for ground transport or storage. The acceptable power range is 30 to 40 hp (22 to 30 kW) and the standard engines used are small 30 hp (22 kW) two-stroke powerplants.[1]The aircraft has a typical empty weight of 240 lb (110 kg) and a gross weight of 500 lb (230 kg), giving a useful load of 260 lb (120 kg). With full fuel of 5 U.S. gallons (19 L; 4.2 imp gal) the payload for the pilot and baggage is 230 lb (100 kg).[1]The standard day, sea level, no wind, take off distance with a 30 hp (22 kW) engine is 100 ft (30 m) and the landing roll is 80 ft (24 m).[1]The manufacturer estimated the construction time from the supplied plans as 200 hours.[1]By 1998 the company reported that 70 sets of plans had been sold and that 10 aircraft were completed and flying.[1]Data from AeroCrafter[1]General characteristicsPerformance"

While working as a Research Engineer in Los Angeles, California his work with aircraft radio detection finders led him to the idea of a portable metal detectors. Fisher shared the idea with Albert Einstein who correctly predicted the proliferation of hand held metal detector use.Although the actual inventor of the hand-held metal detector is disputed, the hand-held metal detector was made in 1925 and was first patented by Dr. Gerhard Fisher in 1931. A metal detector had been invented some forty years earlier (1881) by Alexander Graham Bell for the sole purpose of locating a lead bullet in President James A. Garfield.He founded Fisher Research Laboratory to develop and market the hand held metal detectors in 1931."

1989 French Open,28 October 2018,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_French_Open,"The 1989 French Open was a tennis tournament that took place on the outdoor clay courts at the Stade Roland Garros in Paris, France. The tournament was held from 29 May until 11 June. It was the 93rd staging of the French Open, and the second Grand Slam tennis event of 1989.For the first time in French Open history the Singles championships were won by two teenagers – Michael Chang (17 years, 3 months) and Arantxa Sánchez (17 years, 6 months). Chang still holds the record for youngest ever male Grand Slam singles title winner. He gained admirers for his audacious style of play and battling qualities. Sánchez broke the record for the youngest champion at Roland Garros, a record bettered the following year by Monica Seles (16 years, 6 months).Sánchez's victory made her only the seventh woman to win a Grand Slam tournament in the 1980s; the others being Martina Navratilova, Chris Evert, Tracy Austin, Evonne Goolagong, Steffi Graf and Hana Mandlíková.Steffi Graf's loss in the women's final was her only Grand Slam defeat in two years. She won eight of the nine Grand Slam tournaments from the 1988 Australian Open – 1990 Australian Open. This prevented her from completing a second consecutive Grand Slam and was her 9th Grand Slam final on her record run of 13 finals.One notable débutant was Monica Seles, appearing in her first Grand Slam. She reached the semi-finals without being seeded, and aged only 15. Jennifer Capriati also made her presence felt, becoming the youngest winner (13 years, 2 months) of the girls' singles title – this record was broken in 1993 by Martina Hingis, aged 12.

The Circles of Power,1 June 2017,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Circles_of_Power,"The Circles of Power is volume fifteen in the French comic book science fiction series Valérian and Laureline created by writer Pierre Christin and artist Jean-Claude Mézières.Valérian and Laureline have brought their crippled astroship to a repair yard on the planet Rubanis.  They are quoted a price of seven hundred thousand bloutoks for the repairs but have no money.  They are approached by the three Shingouz who advise them to visit Colonel T'loc, the chief of police, who has a job for them.Taking a taxi cab, they are driven first through the anarchic traffic of the First Circle of the city, where they have left the astroship, and then into the Second Circle which is much less chaotic thanks to the floating mines that keep the traffic in check.  From there, they proceed upwards to the orbital station where Colonel T'loc has his headquarters.  With the taxi left waiting, they are brought to T'loc's office.  The colonel tells them that he is concerned about trouble that is brewing in the Circles of Rubanis.  The police force are too busy lining their own pockets to deal with the situation and so T'loc has turned to Valérian and Laureline to help him.  He describes the five Circles of Rubanis: the First, dedicated to heavy industry; the Second, designated for business and the Third, dedicated to shopping and entertainment. The Fourth Circle is dedicated to the aristopatrons: the leaders of the religions, the public service and business.  It is from this Circle that T'loc receives his orders via a machine in his office.  No orders have been received for a long time.  Valérian and Laureline ask to examine the machine but T'loc forbids it saying that to open the machine is to risk their lives.  T'loc doesn't know where his orders come from and this troubles him.  He wants Valérian and Laureline to investigate the Fifth and final Circle – the Circle of Power, a Circle that no one enters and offers them seven hundred thousand bloutoks.  Valérian and Laureline ask for expenses on top of what's offered but T'loc refuses.  Valérian moves to open the machine and T'loc pulls his gun on him warning him that if the machine is opened the Scunindar virus will spread.  T'loc relents and agrees to double their risk bonus and gives them an up front payment – a Grumpy Transmuter from Bluxte, able to duplicate any currency it is fed.Given a contact name to start their investigations from T'loc's deputy, Indicator Croupachof, they ask their taxi driver to take them to the Third Circle.  As they fly through the Second Circle, they are attacked by a woman driving a black limousine.  The driver manages to evade her and she crashes her vehicle.  Landing in the Third Circle, Valérian, Laureline and the taxi driver make their way to the bar where they are to meet their contact.  Waiting for their contact, they find that the Shingouz are also in the bar – it is their job to introduce the contact.  The contact arrives and demands 100 Ebebe pearls for the information.  Laureline puts the grumpy to work and the contact tells there is a way into the Fifth Circle through an old, abandoned entrance.  Suddenly they are interrupted – Na'Zultra, the woman in the limousine who attacked them, enters, accompanied by her henchmen and swinging a cretiniser whip.  Valérian and the taxi driver duck under the table out of the influence of the whip but Laureline and the Shingouz are mesmerized.  The contact tries to escape but is shot. The henchmen grab Laureline and make off with her.  Valérian tries to follow but is too late.The taxi driver, who is called S'Traks, offers to help – he thinks he can find Na'Zultra through the mechanics who will be sent from the Fourth Circle to recover her crashed limousine.  Valérian and S'Traks return to where the wreck of the vehicle lies and hide themselves inside it.  Just as S'Traks planned, the recovery vehicle arrives and takes them into the Fourth Circle.  As they explore, a group of aristopatrons – priests, high officials and businessmen – come marching by. S'Traks is shocked by their appearance – their necks have elongated and their heads have shrunk.  Ambushing some stragglers, Valérian and S'Traks steal their clothes in order to disguise themselves and follow the crowd.Elsewhere, Na'Zultra is interrogating Laureline.  Na'Zultra explains that she intends to seize power   on Rubanis and demands the information that Laureline got from the contact.  Laureline tells her that Na'Zultra had killed him before he could say anything.  Unsatisfied with Laureline's answers, she reveals that she has a machine similar to the one in Colonel T'loc's office.  Na'Zultra explains that the Scunindar virus affects the mind and orders her henchmen to strap Laureline into the machine.  Before they can switch on another of Na'Zultra's men arrives to warn her that two intruders have been detected at an aristopatron meeting.  Realising that it must be Valérian and S'Traks, Na'Zultra departs with her men leaving just one guard to look after Laureline who is still strapped into the machine.  Left alone with the guard, Laureline offers to make him rich if he will release her.  Intrigued, the guard undoes the straps and Laureline shows him the Grumpy Transmuter.  The guard asks Laureline to get the Grumpy to transmute some Glods from Vlago-Vlago.  While the guard is distracted watching the Grumpy going about making the Glods, Laureline sneaks up behind him and knocks him unconscious.Exploring the corridors of the Fourth Circle, searching for Valérian and the way out, Laureline finds a group of aristopatrons connected to a series of the machines that release the Scunindar virus.  Moving on further she finds Valérian and S'Traks, pinned down by fire from Na'Zultra and her Vlago-Vlago mercenaries.  Laureline manages to distract Na'Zultra for long enough to enable all three to make their escape using the recovery vehicle.Some time later, Valérian, Laureline and S'Traks ponder their next move.  Laureline will try to find out more about the secret entrance to the Fifth Circle while Valérian will report back to T'loc on their progress and S'Traks will recruit a team to take on Na'Zultra's mercenaries.  In the depths of the Third Circle, Laureline meets with the Shingouz again.  She notices how entranced the population are by the screens that located all around the Circle.  The Shingouz explain that they are another variation on the machines Laureline saw in the Fourth Circle. Laureline asks the Shingouz if they can find the ancient service entrance to the Circle of Power.  They tell her of an old real estate salesman who lives in the Second Circle who may still have a set of plans for the Fifth Circle.Arriving at police headquarters, Valérian notices Croupachof's surprise at seeing him again and realises that it was he who warned Na'Zultra.  Meeting with T'loc, Valérian asks why he has been sent on a useless mission since T'loc not only already knows that the aristopatrons have succumbed to the Scunindar virus but that he also has an antidote.  Valérian points to the machine and asks to use it – he will protect himself from the virus by using T'loc's antidote.Elsewhere, in the First Circle, S'Traks is assembling his army from the best pilots in the city.Arriving at an office in the Second Circle with the Shingouz, Laureline visits Dr. Zoump, the real estate salesman who may have a map of the Fifth Circle.Valérian, connected to the machine, is presented with a series of strange images including that of the mysterious Hyper-Prince.  Switching off, Valérian asks T'loc if he is aware that they are putting together an expedition to go into the Circle of Power and find out who is transmitting the images.  T'loc replies that he does and that he is also assembling a team of his own.  They will move once the entrance has been located.  T'loc gives Valerian the agreed fee of one million, seven hundred thousand bloutoks.  As Valérian is picked up from T'loc's headquarters by S'Traks, he notices the large armada of police vehicles that T'loc is assembling.  S'Traks replies that his team is even larger.In the Second Circle, Dr Zoump hands over the map in return for a fee.  Leaving his office Laureline and the Shingouz just miss Na'Zultra and Croupachof who are also seeking the map.Valérian is reunited with Laureline and the Shingouz at the rendezvous point where the S'Traks' has assembled the team for the assault on the Circle of Power.  They take off, closely monitored by both Na'Zultra and her mercenaries and T'loc and his police force.  Finding the entrance, Valérian, Laureline and S'Traks punch their way in.  All they find is a derelict room with automatic cameras transmitting the images of the Hyper-Prince and the Scunindar virus.  Before the cameras lies the Hyper-Prince.  Valérian, unaffected by the virus, snatches the ring from his finger and the Prince crumbles to dust, his ring of authority – a viral sapphire from Scunindar – no longer potent.  At that moment both T'loc and Na'Zultra burst in.  Fighting breaks out between S'Traks' men and T'loc and Na'Zultra's. Valérian, Laureline and the Shingouz make their escape as war breaks out all across Rubanis.Some time later, their astroship repaired and refitted, Valerian and Laureline depart Rubanis.  The Shingouz offer one last piece of information: who is winning the battle on Rubanis – S'Traks!The planet Rubanis in the Constellation of Cassiopeia, previously seen  in Métro Châtelet, Direction Cassiopeia and The Ghosts of Inverloch. Since The Ghosts of Inverloch, Colonel T'loc has relocated his headquarters to an orbital platform. The robot thanatologists seen in The Ghosts of Inverloch seem to have disappeared. As in previous albums, the never-ending traffic congestion is a hallmark of the planet.Rubanis is composed of five distinct circles:"

Paraguayan Army,26 March 2020,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguayan_Army,"The Paraguayan Army is an institution of the State of Paraguay, organized into three divisions and 9, and several commands and directions, went to war three occasions, in the War of the Triple Alliance (1864–1870) against Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, Chaco War (1932–1935) against Bolivia, and the ongoing Paraguayan People's Army insurgency.Paraguay's army was formally established in 1811, the year of the country's independence. For the first several years of Paraguay's existence the commanders of the army, such as Fulgencio Yegros and Pedro Juan Caballero, formed the majority of the cabinet until 1814, when they were replaced by Dr. Jose Gaspar Rodriguez de Francia, who installed himself as supreme dictator for life after a series of political clashes with Yegros. Francia removed all army personnel from the government and reformed the army, which was by now inept and corrupt. He limited the power of the army by declaring that no rank above captain could be achieved, and that after three years of service officers were to be retired. By 1816 there were no officers in the army who had fought at the Tacuari or the Paraguari. Francia's horse-grenadier guard company was the first new unit created and was to form the nucleus of the army. Each captain was given command of a branch of the service, which consisted of line infantry, light infantry, dragoons, chasseurs, hussars and artillery. The infantry, artillery and hussars were stationed in the capital Asuncion, and the rest of the army was stationed in outposts around the country to defend from attacks by Indians. The cavalry would go dismounted during peacetime, and were distinguished by the yellow aiguillette sewn onto their left shoulder. Although no formal wars were fought, conflicts with the Chaco Indians, particularly the sub-groups of the Guaykuru tribes, raged in the borderlands. The size of the army varied according to the magnitude of threat. In 1825 it was 5000 strong, but in 1834 it was only 649 strong. There was also a large number of militia troops, which usually numbered around 25,000.After Francia's death in 1840, Carlos Antonio Lopez assumed power and modernized the army and expanded the navy. He opened an iron foundry at Ybycui that produced arms and bullets and also built up a railway system in the country to transport troops and materiel.Following the succession of Lopez's son, Francisco Solano López, the army was expanded yet further until it was one of the largest in South America, consisting by 1864 of 44 infantry battalions, 46 cavalry regiments and four artillery regiments. In that same year Paraguay fought its first actual war against Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. Despite numerical superiority and initial success, the allies soon upped their game and Paraguay eventually found itself surrounded. Despite constant defeat on the field by the allies, the Paraguayans did not capitulate until Lopez had been killed in 1870, on the run with his 200 remaining men.As of 2016, the Paraguayan Army had a total strength of 10,600 personnel, including 2,500 conscripts.[1]The Paraguayan Army is composed of Presidential Guard Regiment, two battalions (infantry and military police), an armored squadron and a battery of field artillery (plus the Mounted Ceremonial Squadron Aca Caraya). Their equipment includes three Argentine modified M4 Sherman tanks, four EE-9 armored cars, four EE-11 armored personnel carriers (APCs), three M-9 halftracks mounting 20mm guns and four M-101 105 mm howitzers. Arguably, this flagship of military rule is structurally and physically the strongest of the EP. The REP is an independent unit from other commands. The EP features two artillery groups (GAC 1–12 88 mm QF-25 and GAC 2–12 105mm M-101) and one antiaircraft artillery group (GAA 13 40 mm L 40/60, Oerlikon 20 mm cannons, and six M-55 4×12, 7.0 mm).Six battalions of combat engineers, one communications battalion, one Special Forces battalion, seven regiments of infantry and six regiments of cavalry comprise the rest of the force. There is little organic aviation available to it.Each corps has a weapons school run by its command. The logistical command manages and addresses materials, mobilization, health care, etc. The command of the Army Institute of Education administers three schools, commissioned and noncommissoned officers, a military academy and the CIMEFOR (a center for pre-military study that trains Reserve officers).Each of the nine divisions that make up the three corps has one or two regiments of infantry or cavalry, its platoon of engineers, its communications section, military police units, etc.The stars worn by Army and Air Force lieutenants (Sub-Teniente, Teniente, Teniente 1ro) and captains are silver in color. The ones worn by the Major, Lieutenant Colonel and Colonel are gold.The army officers branch is denoted by the color of circular pads under the stars, which is also the same color used for the chevron. Red denotes branches such as Infantry and Artillery, while Cavalry is denoted by a pink. A darker red denotes support branches such as Engineering Corps, Communications, and Intelligence. Green means Supply and Transportation, while purple is reserved for the Medicine Branch. Generals' special chevron consists of a woven depiction of the olive and palm found in the national emblem in gold threads.As in the case of the army officers, the army enlisted branch is denoted by the color of their chevrons and bars. The colors and meanings are the same as the ones explained above."

John Watson (Indian Army officer),15 November 2018,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Watson_(Indian_Army_officer),"General Sir John Watson, VC, GCB (6 September 1829 – 23 January 1919) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.  An officer serving with the Bengal Army, Watson received his Victoria Cross for actions at Lucknow during the Indian Mutiny. He later rose to the rank of general in the British Indian Army.Watson was born on 6 September 1829 in Chigwell, Essex.[1] His father was William George Watson.[2] In 1848,[2] at the age of 19, Watson traveled to London seeking to join the army of the British East India Company. Joining the Bengal Army as an officer he was initially sent to Madras. This offered little prospect of action, however, and Watson sought transfer to Bombay.[1]His first combat action came in December 1848 during the Second Anglo-Sikh War when Watson took part in the Siege of Multan, while serving with the 1st Bombay European Fusiliers.[1] Shortly afterwards he took part in the Battle of Gujrat.[3]Watson was 28 years old, and a lieutenant in the 1st Punjab Cavalry, Bengal Army during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place on 14 November 1857 at Lucknow, India, for which he was awarded the VC:Lieut. Watson, on 14 Nov., with his own squadron, and that under Captain, then Lieut. Probyn, came upon a body of the rebel cavalry. The Ressaldar in command of them – a fine specimen of the Hindustani Mussalman – and backed up by some half-dozen equally brave men, rode out to the front. Lieutenant Watson singled out this fine-looking fellow and attacked him. The Ressaldar presented his pistol at Lieut. Watson's breast at a yard's distance and fired, but most providentially without effect; the ball must have by accident previously fallen out. Lieutenant Watson ran the man through with his sword and dismounted him; but the native officer, nothing daunted, drew his tulwar, and with his sowars renewed his attack upon Lieutenant Watson, who bravely defended himself until his own men joined in the melee, and utterly routed the party. In this rencontre Lieutenant Watson received a blow on the head from a tulwar, another on the left arm, which severed his chain gauntlet glove, a tulwar cut on his right arm, which fortunately only divided the sleeve of his jacket, but disabled the arm for some time; a bullet also passed through his coat, and he received a blow on his leg which lamed him for some days afterwards.[4]Following this Watson took part in further fighting around Cawnpore and then the Relief of Lucknow. After this he returned to England briefly on convalescence leave before returning to India.[5] In 1858, Watson raised the 4th Sikh Irregular Cavalry which later became the 6th Duke of Connaught's Own Lancers (Watson's Horse).  He later took part in the Umbeyla Expedition (1863) and commanded the Central India Horse, 1871. He became Resident at Gwalior, 1877; Officiating Adjutant-General in Central India, 1871; commanded the Cavalry despatched from Bombay to Malta, 1878;  and then commanded the Kurram Field Force (Punjab chief's contingent) in the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1879–80).[2] In 1891 he was promoted to the rank of general.[5]Watson also served in a number of others roles including Aide-de-Camp to Her Majesty Empress Victoria, 1870–71 and the Agent to the Governor-General at Baroda from 1882 until 1886, for which he was subsequently knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath  (KCB) in 1886. He was promoted to a Knight Grand Cross of the order (GCB) in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902,[6][7] and was invested by King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 8 August 1902.[8]He was also made Colonel of the Regiment of the 13th Duke of Connaught Lancers in 1904.[2]He died on 23 January 1919, aged 89, at Finchampstead in Berkshire. His grave lies in the churchyard of St James in the village.[5] His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London."
Atomic demolition munition,8 March 2020,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_demolition_munition,"Atomic demolition munitions (ADMs), colloquially known as nuclear land mines, are small nuclear explosive devices. ADMs were developed for both military and civilian purposes. As weapons, they were designed to be exploded in the forward battle area, in order to block or channel enemy forces. Non-militarily, they were designed for demolition, mining or earthmoving. However, apart from testing, they have never been used for either purpose.Instead of being delivered to the target by missiles, rockets, or artillery shells, ADMs were intended to be emplaced by soldiers. Due to their relatively small size and light weight, ADMs could be emplaced by military engineers or special forces teams, then detonated on command or by timer to create massive obstructions. By destroying key terrain features or choke points such as bridges, dams, mountain passes and tunnels, ADMs could serve to create physical as well as radiological obstacles to the movement of enemy forces and thus channel them into prepared killing zones.[5][6]According to official accounts, the United States deployed ADMs overseas in Italy and West Germany (Fulda Gap) during the Cold War.[7][8][9] The most modern types (SADM and MADM) were deployed in South Korea.[10][11][12] Seymour Hersh referred to the deployment of ADMs along the Golan Heights by Israel in the early 1980s.[13]ADMs have never been used commercially although similar small devices, often modified to cut down on fission yield and maximize fusion, have been deeply buried to put out gas well fires as part of the Soviet test program.[clarification needed]The Soviet Union tested the use of nuclear devices for mining and natural gas extraction (stimulating gas flow in a similar manner to fracking) on several occasions starting in the mid-1960s, as part of the Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy program. Tests for similar purposes were carried out in the United States under Operation Plowshare, but due to radioactive contamination caused by the tests, no direct commercial use was made of the technology although they were successful at nucleosynthesis and probing the composition of the Earth's deep crust by Vibroseis which has helped mining company prospecting.[14][15][16]In the 1950s and 1960s, the United States developed several different types of lightweight nuclear devices. The main one was the W54, a cylinder 40 by 60 cm (about 16 by 24 inches) that weighed 23 kg (50 lb). It was fired by a mechanical timer and had a variable yield equivalent to between 10 tons and 1 kt of TNT.  A Field non-variable yield version of the W54 nuclear device (called the Mk-54 Davy Crockett warhead for the M-388 Crockett round) was used in the Davy Crockett Weapon System.The Mk 30 Mod 1 Tactical Atomic Demolition Munition (TADM) was a portable atomic bomb, consisting of a Mk 30 warhead installed in a X-113 case. The X-113 was 26 inches (66 cm) in diameter and 70 in (178 cm) long, and looked like corrugated culvert pipe. The whole system weighed 840 pounds (381 kg). Production of the TADM started in 1961 and all were removed from stockpile by 1966. A weapons effect test of the TADM was made in the 1962 Johnny Boy (Johnnie Boy[17]) shot of the Dominic II series (which is more accurately referred to as Operation Sunbeam), the yield of Johnny Boy/Johnnie Boy was about .5 kt.[18] A preceding ADM test which resulted in a comparable yield, was test shot Danny Boy of Operation Nougat, also producing a yield of about 0.5 kiloton.[19]The Special Atomic Demolition Munition (SADM) was a family of man-portable nuclear weapons fielded by the US military in the 1960s, but never used in actual combat.  The US Army planned to use the weapons in Europe in the event of a Soviet invasion. US Army Engineers would use the weapon to irradiate, destroy, and deny key routes of communication through limited terrain such as the Fulda Gap.  Troops were trained to parachute into Soviet occupied western Europe with the SADM and destroy power plants, bridges, and dams.The weapon was designed to allow one person to parachute from any type of aircraft carrying the weapon package and place it in a harbor or other strategic location that could be accessed from the sea. Another parachutist without a weapon package would follow the first to provide support as needed.The two-person team would place the weapon package in the target location, set the timer, and swim out into the ocean where they would be retrieved by a submarine or a high-speed surface water craft.The Medium Atomic Demolition Munition (MADM) was a tactical nuclear weapon developed by the United States during the Cold War. They were designed to be used as nuclear land mines and for other tactical purposes, with a relatively low explosive yield from a W45 warhead, between 1 and 15 kilotons. Each MADM weighted around 400 lb (181 kg) total.  They were produced between 1965 and 1986.[20]In the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States and Russia developed a deep cooperation designed to assure the security of Russia’s nuclear arsenal. While a number of steps were taken to consolidate and improve the security of Russia’s strategic nuclear arms, particularly under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program, concern remained over the security of the Russian tactical nuclear weapons arsenal. In particular, a serious debate arose over the status of what are known as “suitcase nuclear weapons,” very small Soviet-era nuclear devices. The term suitcase nuke is generally used to describe any type of small, man-portable nuclear device although there is serious debate as to the validity of the term itself. In a worst case analysis, a suitcase nuke would be small enough to be hand-carried into a major population or leadership center (downtown Manhattan or Capitol Hill, for example) undetected and then detonated. Although, by most accounts, the yield of such a device is likely far less than ten kilotons, its combined effects may have the potential to kill tens of thousands, if not more. There is a great deal of confusion over just how many of these suitcase devices exist or if they even exist at all. By some accounts, the Soviet Union built hundreds of these devices, of which several dozen were missing. Based on other reports, suitcase nukes were never built in large numbers or were never deployed.There is no definitive open source information on the number, location, security, or status of these suitcase nuclear bombs. No Soviet suitcase bomb or any of its presumed components has ever been found, much less used, in the three decades after the collapse of the USSR. As of 2018[update], it is likely they would not work or would fizzle at worst by lack of the required specialized maintenance common to all nuclear weapons, if they ever existed.On February 23, 1999, the PBS investigative program Frontline aired a special on Russian nuclear security which included a series of interviews with several of the individuals who spoke publicly during the 1997 debate on suitcase nukes.[21] Alexei Yablokov appeared and reasserted his position that some number of small atomic charges had been built, even going so far as to speak of their weight (“thirty kilos, forty kilos”). Yablokov accused the Russian government of misleading the public on the situation, pointing to the inconsistencies in denials by the FSB, MINATOM, and the information that was publicly available on the Internet (“…if I’m looking at a [picture] of an American weapon, I must be sure that we have an analogy…″). On the same program, Congressman Curt Weldon recounted a meeting he held in December 1997 with Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev. During this meeting, Weldon asked Sergeyev specifically about the small ADM devices. According to Weldon, Sergeyev’s response was: “Yes, we did build them, we are in the process of destroying them, and by the year 2000 we will have destroyed all of our small atomic demolition devices.” Weldon went on to express confidence in Sergeyev’s statement but also raised concern as to whether or not the Russian government had accounted for all of its nuclear devices. Frontline also featured several American and Russian experts and officials who presented differing views on the subject. General Vladimir Dvorkin, a former officer in the Strategic Rocket Forces and subsequently Director of the Fourth Central Research Institute in Moscow, admitted that “some small devices existed in the United States and Russia” but that something that small would have a very limited shelf life and would have little deterrent value. Dvorkin discounted the validity of Lebed’s[non sequitur] statements, saying “…Lebed is probably the least informed person as far as this topic is concerned…an expert in military folklore.” The former commander of U.S. nuclear forces, retired General Eugene Habiger, also appeared on Frontline and expressed doubt about the size of such devices, calling the term suitcase “a little optimistic.” Additionally, Habiger spoke of the systems set up by the Russians to track their nuclear weapons, saying “If the Russians were as deadly serious about the accountability of the nuclear weapons that I saw and have been involved with, I can only surmise that they have the same concerns with the smaller weapons.”By late 1999, the concern had expanded from nuclear armed Chechen rebels to include concerns about Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaeda network. Although unsubstantiated, some reports suggested that bin Laden had already managed to acquire weapons from the Russian nuclear arsenal. In August 1999, Voice of America broadcast a story about the threat posed by bin Laden. In it, Yossef Bodansky, an American terrorism analyst, author, and head of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Non-Conventional Warfare claimed that he had learned, through sources in Russia and the Middle East, that bin Laden had “a few of the ex-Soviet ‘suitcase’ bombs acquired through the Chechens.″[22] Two months later, on October 5, the Moscow daily Komsomolskaya Pravda published an interview in which Bodansky, citing “various intelligence sources,” claimed that bin Laden had acquired, through Kazakhstan, “from several to twenty tactical nuclear warheads.” Bodansky also claimed that bin Laden had attempted to buy “nuclear suitcases” in Kazakhstan. In the same article, the director of the Atomic Energy Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan declared that all nuclear weapons had been removed “long ago” from Kazakhstan and that suitcase nuclear devices were never built in Kazakh territory. The head of counterintelligence for the Kazakhstani Committee on National Security told Komsomolskaya Pravda that all nuclear weapons were removed from Kazakhstan in 1995 in accordance with the START I treaty and denied reports that bin Laden had attempted to purchase nuclear weapons there.[23] Bodansky’s claims surfaced again on October 25, 1999 when The Jerusalem Report published an article on bin Laden and suitcase nuclear devices. In this report, Bodansky’s claim of “a few to twenty” weapons was repeated. In addition, Bodansky claimed that bin Laden had purchased the weapons using “$30 million in cash and two tons of Afghan heroin.”[24] Very little information is available to back Bodansky’s claims and they remain in doubt.Following the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States, fresh attention was focused on al-Qaeda’s desire for weapons of mass destruction but with more urgency than in the past. A serious concern was that al-Qaeda terrorists might attempt to obtain Russian warheads or weapon-usable nuclear materials. Former GRU Colonel Stanislav Lunev’s 1998 statements were resurrected following the attacks. During an appearance on CBS, Lunev reasserted his claim that suitcase bombs existed, even going so far as to claim that bin Laden had obtained several of the devices from the former Soviet Union. In the same segment, Michael O’Hanlon of the Brookings Institution discounted Lunev’s claims: “Our view is that this is not a major worry. If those devices ever existed, they were under the control of the Soviet state, and not available to terrorists.”[25] On December 20, 2001 UPI reported that the FBI had stepped up its investigation into terrorist access to Russian nuclear stockpiles. Representative Weldon, once again at the forefront of the debate, stated “Do I think he [bin Laden] has a  [sic] small atomic demolition munitions, which were built by the Soviets in the Cold War? Probably doubtful.”[26]On January 17, 2002, Russia’s Atomic Energy Minister, Aleksandr Rumyantsev, told Interfax it would be impossible for terrorists to construct a portable nuclear weapon, citing a lack of “necessary potential and materials.” The Interfax report went on to state “major nuclear powers have an effective system of control over miniature nuclear charges, which weigh a total of several dozen kilograms.” According to Rumyantsev “all of these [miniature nuclear devices] are registered… it is technically impossible for such charges to find their way into the hands of terrorists.”[27]"

Gyromancer,28 March 2020,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyromancer,"Gyromancer is a puzzle and role-playing video game developed by PopCap Games in collaboration with Square Enix. The player moves through a map of an enchanted forest, battling monsters using their own summoned monsters through a puzzle-game battle based on PopCap's Bejeweled Twist. In these battles, the player rotates groups of four in a grid of gems to line up three or more jewels of the same color; when enough lines have been created damage is dealt to the enemy. Between battles, a story is told through a series of cutscenes, while the player and the summoned monsters gain experience and power using role-playing elements.The initial idea for the game was inspired by Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords, a 2007 video game which members of both companies were playing at the time. The game was proposed to Square Enix half-jokingly by PopCap's chief creative officer Jason Kapalka during a meeting between the two companies in 2007, and was released on the Xbox Live Arcade and on the Steam platform for Windows PCs by Square Enix on November 18, 2009. Gyromancer received a generally positive reception from reviewers. Critics took issue with perceived limited graphics, some aspects of the music, and a weak and confusing plot. Despite these flaws, in general they found the game to be fun and addictive, and to have a great deal of replay value.Players assume the role of Rivel, an immortal summoner who ventures through the enchanted Aldemona Wood. He has been tasked to track down the rebel group Temperance, led by Quraist Kingsley, who have assassinated a member of the royal family. The forest at times magically seals itself, trapping visitors inside, and is rumored to hold a source of mystical power for which Quraist is searching.[1][2] The game consists of twelve stages, which are large branching maps that allow the player to move from points represented by stars to adjacent points. Each stage contains its own objectives, from defeating beasts that block the player's way, to solving puzzles before time runs out. Additional stages are available for purchase as downloadable content.[3] There are multiple optional objectives per stage, in addition to a main goal.[2] Many areas of each stage are initially blocked off, and can only be entered by replaying the stage later in the game.[1]While moving through the stages, the player encounters many monsters, and is forced to battle against them using one of their own monsters in a puzzle battle based on Bejeweled Twist. The creatures are variations on fantasy archetypes and include demons, giant spiders, giant frogs, and beasts inspired by Dungeons & Dragons.[1] The player can only bring three creatures into a stage out of all of the ones that they have, and selects one of the three when a battle begins. A grid of different colored gems is displayed, and the player can select blocks of four jewels and rotate them clockwise. If a line of three or more identical gems is formed, the gems disappear, allowing all of the jewels above the now-vacant spaces in the grid to fall down a row to replace them. New gems appear at the top of the screen to fill any holes in the grid. If new lines of gems are formed from this movement, the process repeats. Whenever lines are formed, a gauge is filled slightly for the player; when it is full a special gem appears on the board. When that gem is formed into a line, damage is done to the enemy. The enemy also has a gauge, which is filled every time the player performs a rotation, and damage is dealt directly to the player when it is filled.[3]Later in the game, non-rotatable gems can be found, and the player is punished for rotations that do not lead to a match by having the enemy's gauge fill faster. The amount of damage that the player can take or deliver is dependent on the monster used in battle, and using a beast in battle earns experience points which can increase the power of that summon. Each monster has a corresponding color, and matching gems that are the same color as the player's chosen monster or the enemy makes the player's gauge fill faster or theirs slower.[3] Enemy monsters can change gems on the board to skulls, which cause damage to the player if they are not lined up within a certain number of moves.[1] After being defeated in a battle, enemy monsters are added to the list of creatures that the player chooses from when they start a stage. New monsters can also be found hidden in the stages, along with items that can be used during battles.[2]The game was first thought up in 2007 during a meeting between PopCap and Square Enix, which had published several of PopCap's games in Japan. Jason Kapalka, the co-founder and chief creative officer of PopCap, claims that he half-jokingly proposed a game collaboration between the two companies that would combine a role-playing game with Bejeweled-style gameplay, calling it “Final Fantasy Bejeweled”.[4] Kapalka was envisioning creating a similar game to Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords, a 2007 video game which members of the development staff of both companies were playing at the time.[5] The idea attracted the attention of Yuichi Murasawa, designer of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, and the game began formal development. To differentiate the game from Puzzle Quest, the gameplay was based around Bejeweled Twist rather than Bejeweled, which Kopalka feels fit the art design of the game more.[4] Other candidates considered were Zuma and Peggle, but they were dropped as the developers felt that they did not fit in with the combat theme.[5] PopCap developed the early prototype for the game, then allowed Square Enix to complete the bulk of the work in designing and creating the game, especially in regards to the RPG aspects.[4] Square Enix and PopCap announced the game on September 24, 2009.[6] It was published by Square Enix on the Xbox Live Arcade and on the Steam platform for Windows PCs on November 18, 2009.[7] A downloadable pack of maps and a pack of items were made available for sale a week after launch on November 23, 2009 for both versions of the game.[8]The game was directed by Murasawa and produced by Yoshinori Kamei. The story was written by Kyoko Kitahara, who had previously worked on Final Fantasy Tactics Advance with Murasawa, and the art direction was led by Yuki Matsuzawa. The soundtrack was created by Tsuyoshi Sekito. Matsuzawa was asked to make the art style that of a dark fantasy and to focus more on making the visuals realistic rather than fantasy-oriented, so that it would appeal more to players outside Japan.[5]Gyromancer received a generally positive reception from reviewers. While many critics noted its similarity to Puzzle Quest, the gameplay was still described as being fun and addictive by Brett Todd of GameSpot, and similar praises were made by Daemon Hattfield of IGN and Eurogamer's Oli Welsh.[1][2][3] Welsh claimed that it had a great deal of replay value, and praised the surprisingly varied story missions.[3] Game Informer's Matt Miller disagreed slightly, stating that while the game had some replay value, it was limited by the lack of depth to the RPG elements of the game.[11] Although the paintings of the monsters and game world were rated highly by critics, the art direction itself was criticized. Todd called the graphics murky and grainy and noted the lack of animation in the battles or cutscenes, in which two-dimensional pictures of the characters speaking slide back and forth like cardboard cutouts rather than perform realistic movements.[1] Welsh added that the stage maps were crudely portrayed.[3] Hattfield did not share those concerns, but did note say that they felt that the portraits of monsters were reused for different monsters too often.[2] Miller disagreed completely with the other critics, saying that the game looks great and that even the map screen between battles has a polished appearance.[11] A reviewer from GameTrailers also enjoyed the aesthetic of the game, saying that despite the still images and simple effects, the game made an effort to look and sound the part of a deeper game, which they felt would increase the player's enjoyment.[12]The plot was similarly criticized, with Welsh calling it endearing, largely unpronounceable rubbish, while Hattfield termed it not Gyromancer's strong point and a bit hard to follow.[2][3] Miller dismissed it as generic and lackluster, while the GameTrailers reviewer said that it was somewhat thrown together. All the reviews, however, noted that the plot was largely irrelevant to the game next to the gameplay elements.[11][12] Todd criticized the tutorial system as very inadequate, as well as the beyond cheesy music, a criticism that Hattfield left only to the Japanese videogame metal during boss battles, rather than the rest of Sekito's rousing orchestral tunes.[1][2] Overall, however, the reviewers felt that Gyromancer was a fun, casual game.[1][2]"
History of the Royal Malaysia Police,15 January 2020,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Royal_Malaysia_Police,"The Royal Malaysia Police trace their existence to the Malacca Sultanate in the 1400s and developed through administration by the Portuguese, the Dutch, modernization by the British beginning in the early 1800s, and the era of Malaysian independence.The police system began in the Malacca Sultanate. Police responsibilities were combined with military duties. The sultan was the absolute authority: judge, religious leader, commander of the military and interpreter of the law. The sultanate's legal code was known as Undang-Undang Melaka.The bendahara was second in command, after the sultan. He was the sultan's advisor, chief administrator, and sometimes a warlord. Bendahara Paduka Raja Tun Perak was the sultanate's best-known bendahara.The Temenggung was responsible for maintaining security and peace statewide, including in the palace grounds. His tasks were arresting criminals, building prisons and imposing sentences.Village chiefs, representatives of the sultan, were tasked with tax collection, law enforcement and public safety. The traditional police systems changed when the sultanate was conquered by the Portuguese, led by Afonso de Albuquerque, on 10 August 1511.Portugal ruled Malacca for over a century. On 14 January 1641, a Dutch fleet conquered it with help from Johor troops in a battle at Aceh. The Dutch ruled Malacca with a combined military and Portuguese system. Its police force, known as Burgher Guard, was formed as the European population increased; the lower ranks were made up of Malaccans. Head villagers continued their duties as they did in the Malacca Sultanate under Dutch rule.When the British took over Malacca in 1795 (while Sumatera's Bangkahulu province remained under Dutch rule), William Farquhar was elected as the British military governor and the Dutch officers remained in their positions. The Malacca justice council was allowed to function as a magistrate and continue the Burgher Guard police duties.On 11 August 1786, Francis Light came to Penang Island and named it Prince of Wales Island. The population of Penang at that time was small and mostly Malay fishermen. Three years later, its population had increased to 10,000 through immigration. Light felt a need for a police force; he pleaded his case to his superiors in India, but it was not well-received. His superiors later promoted him to superintendent, and instructed him to work alone.In 1787, several riots occurred in Penang. European sailors were involved, and two Siamese were killed. Light wrote to East India Company governor Lord Cornwallis in India asking for legislation and a police force, but this request was also rejected. In 1792, he appointed community leaders for the Malays, the Chinese and the South Indians to act as magistrates in minor cases; other cases were presented to the superintendent. Each leader had five assistants. Although police responsibilities included water supply, registration of births, fire prevention and jail duty, their primary job was to uphold the law.Europeans were not subject to local laws; when a European was involved in a 1793 murder case, Light had no jurisdiction; he again unsuccessfully asked the English East India Company director for a unified police force. He died on 21 October 1794, and was replaced by Forbes Ross Macdonald in 1796. Colonel Arthur Wellesley stopped at Penang during his journey to Manila. Noting the public-safety situation in Penang, he urged the Europeans to appoint a magistrate. On 19 April 1800, George Leith arrived in Penang as the new lieutenant-general. Four months later, John Dicken was appointed magistrate.In early 1804, William Farquhar arrived in Penang to replace Leith as lieutenant-general. At the time, the police force was ineffective. The following year, the Penang administration was reshuffled; a governor was appointed, and a council established. On 25 March 1807, a charter was accepted; Penang established a court and a better police force, based on the charter.The British East Indies Company acquired Singapore in 1819. Although Singapore progressed rapidly, Malacca and Penang did not. The three British colonies in Malaya were united in 1826, with Penang its administrative centre. In 1830, the Straits Settlements were governed by Resident Robert Fullerton; each province was governed by a deputy resident. Two years later, the Straits Settlements were united under a governor; the administrative centre moved to Singapore. The deputy residents were appointed resident counselors.The 1867 move of the Straits Settlements from India to the British government, important to the history of Malaya, did not immediately affect the Straits Settlements police. The Police Force Ordinance, amended in 1871, was operative from 1872 until the arrival of the Japanese; all police forces in the Straits Settlements were controlled by the chief of police in Singapore. Penang and Malacca were led by a superintendent, who acted as the chief police officer. The first police chief of the Straits was Samuel Dunlop.The British resident system was established in the Malaya states in 1874, pioneered by Perak. In 1895, four Federated Malay States were merged into a federation.The federation united all its police forces on 1 July 1896. According to the federation's constitution, the police force, customs, Department of Survey, labour and defence departments were placed under government jurisdiction (headquartered in Kuala Lumpur). Its police force was headed by a commissioner and a chief  of police. Although the commissioner was responsible for upper administration and surveillance, the police force was controlled by the Malay Associate States Chief Secretary; according to Section 3 of the Police Force Enactment (1924), The Superintendent and administration of the Police Force shall be in the hands of the Commissioner and subject to the orders and control of the Chief Secretary.The first Federated States Police Commissioner was Captain H. C. Syers (superintendent of Selangor), moved the state police headquarters from Klang to Kuala Lumpur. He was followed by Christian Wagner.Under Syers, the police changed; a blue uniform was introduced. State uniforms were differentiated by the shape of the button and badge. Syers reformed police administration in Perak. At that time the Perak contingent had 842 members, 15 European officers, 472 officers, Sikh and Pathan officers, 14 orderlies and 302 lower-ranking officers and Malay constables. In Selangor there were six European police officers, 32 Pathans and 500 lower-ranking officers and Malay constables. With the establishment of the Malay States Guides under Robert Sandilands Frowd Walker in 1896, the police force was increased to six infantry companies and two artillery companies (900 members).[1]The Pahang police chief was named Duff, and his team had 245 members. F. W. Talbot led the Negeri Sembilan contingent. There were two inspectors, 56 Sikh officers and 250 low ranks and Malay constables. Around 1902 the police force had 2,160 members, three deputy commissioners, two assistant commissioners, 25 inspectors, two bumiputera officers, 1,961 low-ranking officers and constables, 93 detectives and 14 orderlies. The contingents were armed with Martini-Enfield converted carbines. Police officers were usually recruited from the Indian army. A training centre was established at the Bluff Road compound in October 1903.To encourage Malays to enlist in the police force, Sultan Alang lskandar of Perak was appointed assistant commissioner on 1 August 1905. Thirty-seven years later, the training centre was moved to PULAPOL (the Malaysian Police Training Centre).The Federated Malay States Police increased from 2,138 to 3,241 officers, and the number of Europeans increased from 41 to 72. The chief problem faced at the time was gambling in the Chinese community.The Police Force Act was passed on 9 January 1924, enumerating the roles and responsibilities of the Federated Malay States Police. The armed police were recognised as a civilian (rather than a military) body in 1934. Malays, Chinese and Indians were recruited, commanded by British officers. After Indian independence, Sikhs and Punjabis enlisted. Their uniform consisted of a songkok, tunic and trousers (similar to a British policeman, but white), with a sarong on top.[2]During World War II, when Malaya was conquered by the Japanese, the Federated Malay States Police was eliminated. The last police chief, Edward Bagot, fled to Singapore after British defence forces failed to stop the Japanese army advance. When Singapore fell to the Japanese, he was captured.[3] Bagot had written the 15 June 1941 Report on the Strikes in Selangor, predicting the worst surrender in British military history.[4]In 1939, Straits Settlements Police Chief A. H. Dickinson was appointed Civil Security Officer in Malaya. He was responsible for arranging the Malayan defence against Imperial Japanese Army threats.In Selangor and Negeri Sembilan, special constables and extra police constables strengthened the police force. Police forces in Kedah, Perak and Kelantan were ordered to patrol the border areas between Malaya and Thailand. At that time, anti-British groups stepped up subversive activities. Anti-British campaigns were waged, particularly by two newspapers owned by the Malayan Communist Party: Emancipation News and Vanguard News.On 9 December 1941, Imperial Japanese forces landed in Kelantan and Terengganu. The Japanese developed a military administration in Malaya. The police force continued to function, but it was used by the Japanese as a means of oppression.At the end of 1945 and in early 1946, the British tried to establish a Malayan Union which had been planned in London. Despite violent opposition, the union became effective on 1 April 1946 and the Civil Affairs Police Force, Malay Peninsula became the Malayan Union Police Force.The withdrawal of the Imperial Japanese Army at the end of World War II disrupted the Malayan economy. Problems included unemployment, low wages and scarce, expensive food. There was considerable labour unrest, and many strikes occurred from 1946 to 1948. The British administration attempted to quickly repair Malaya's economy, since revenue from Malaya's tin and rubber industries was important to Britain's post-war recovery. Protesters were dealt with by arrest and deportation, and became increasingly militant. On 16 June 1948, three European plantation managers were killed in Sungai Siput, Perak.[5]The British enacted emergency measures, first in Perak (in response to the Sungai Siput killings) and then nationwide. The Malayan Communist Party and other left-wing parties were outlawed, and the police were authorised to imprison communists (and those suspected of assisting communists) without trial. The initial government strategy was primarily to guard important economic targets, such as mines and plantationes. Harold Rawdon Briggs, the British Army's director of operations in Malaya, developed a strategy known as the Briggs Plan. Its central tenet was that the best way to defeat an insurgency was to cut the insurgents off from their supporters.The British had 13 infantry battalions in Malaya at the beginning of the emergency, including seven partly-formed Gurkha battalions, three British battalions, two battalions of the Royal Malay Regiment and a British Royal Artillery regiment used as infantry.[6] At all levels of government (national, state and district), military and civil authority was assumed by a committee of military, police and civilian officials. This allowed intelligence from all sources to be rapidly evaluated and disseminated, and permitted the coordination of anti-guerrilla measures.Duli Yang Maha Mulia, Yang di-Pertuan Agong Abdul Rahman of Negeri Sembilan agreed to bestow the title Royal on the Federal Malaya Police Force on 24 July 1958, and it became known as the Royal Federation Of Malayan Police. The title was bestowed in appreciation of the role played by the police during the Malayan Emergency. Among those present at the parade by 700 police officers at the Police Training Centre were Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister Dato' Abdul Razak Hussin, Police Commissioner W. L. R. Carbonell, Deputy Commissioner C. H. Fenner and Singapore Police Commissioner A. E. G. Bladers. Three other Commonwealth police forces had a Royal title: the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the Royal Hong Kong Police Force. According to police records, 1,346 policemen were killed in the line of duty during the emergency; 10,698 communists were killed, 5,972 by the police, who were tasked with combating attempts to establish a communist state by force and violence.[7]The motto Bersedia Berkhidmat (Ready To Serve) was introduced by Police Commissioner Arthur Young on 15 December 1952. In Operation Service, Police Commissioner Directive No. 36, 1952, Young stressed the creation of understanding between civilians and police and hoped to counter negative views of the force."
Oklahoma State Highway 59,22 October 2016,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_State_Highway_59,"State Highway 59, abbreviated SH-59, is a 93-mile (150 km) state highway in central Oklahoma. It runs from Criner, Oklahoma in McClain Co. to Wewoka.SH-59 begins at SH-39 north of Criner and immediately heads due south through that town. It turns due east six miles (9.6 km) north of Lindsay, serving Payne instead. After a one-mile (1.6 km) concurrency with SH-24, SH-59 crosses SH-74 and has an interchange with I-35.Shortly after passing under the interstate, it meets US-77 south of Wayne, and passes through the small towns of Rosedale and Byars. Five miles (8 km) east of Byars, it meets U.S. Highway 177 and turns northward to join with it. SH-3W joins the concurrency five miles later.The three highways cross over the South Canadian River to enter Pottawatomie Co. just south of Asher. In Asher, SH-59 meets SH-39 a second time, and six miles (10 km) later it splits off from US-177 and SH-3W to head east again, through St. Louis, Oklahoma and Maud. It forms a concurrency with US-377/SH-99/SH-3E south of Seminole, before splitting off near Bowlegs. It meets US-270 west of Wewoka, and then ends two miles (3 km) later.SH-59 was first added to the state highway system in 1932 and was entirely contained within McClain County, running from Wayne to State Highway 18 (present-day US-177).[1] It was extended eastward to end at SH-48 (present-day US-377/SH-99) north of Bowlegs in 1947 or 1948.[3] It was extended to its present eastern terminus in 1965 or 1966,[4] and no significant changes have been made since.SH-59A runs from US-177/SH-59 east to connect with SH-3W south of SH-59's own connection with the highway. This allows eastbound travelers to more easily access Ada. It is 5.27 miles (8.48 km) long.[5][6]SH-59B runs from SH-59 south to connect with SH-19 just east of Lindsay.

The roughly-centered entry leads into a hallway, with Reich's laboratory on the right and a suite of rooms on the left that included a kitchen, bathrooms, and playroom for Reich's son.  The upper level, accessed by stairs at the back of the hall, included a bathroom, office, and living quarters.  The walls are finished in knotty pine throughout, with plywood ceilings and vinyl flooring.[1]The present conference center is an L-shaped wood-frame structure, built in 1945 and designated by Reich as the Students' Laboratory.
